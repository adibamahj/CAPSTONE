            "answer": "Connect the oscilloscope probe across the output terminal and ground. Make sure to use the correct probe attenuation (typically 10x) and verify the circuit has proper DC biasing."

            "question": "What is the purpose of a feedback resistor in an amplifier?",
            "answer": "The feedback resistor controls the gain and stability of the amplifier. It determines the closed-loop gain when used with an input resistor in op-amp configurations."

            "question": "What is the difference between blocking and non-blocking assignments in Verilog?",
            "answer": "Blocking assignments execute sequentially (`=`), while non-blocking (`<=`) execute concurrently. Always use non-blocking in clocked always blocks."

            "answer": "1. First ensure that the voltage supply button is lit up (turned on). 2. Check your probes by connecting the tips of the ground and power to the tips of the multimeter to ensure the probes are working. You can also connect via breadboard."

            "question": "The oscilloscope is not displaying a waveform — what should I check?",
            "answer": "Confirm probe connection, vertical scale, time base settings, and that the trigger level is set correctly. Check your probe connection directly using the waveform generator as well as the digital signal probe."
