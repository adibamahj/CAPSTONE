      "question": "How do I measure the output of an op-amp circuit in the lab?",
      "answer": "Connect the oscilloscope probe across the output terminal and ground. Make sure to use the correct probe attenuation (typically 10x) and verify the circuit has proper DC biasing."

      "question": "What is the purpose of a feedback resistor in an amplifier?",
      "answer": "The feedback resistor controls the gain and stability of the amplifier. It determines the closed-loop gain when used with an input resistor in op-amp configurations."
